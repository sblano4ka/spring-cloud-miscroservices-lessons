Fault Tolerance


1. Service goes down
You should have multiple instances handled by Ribbon and registered in Eureka

2. Services are slow
When one service is slow it may lead to available threads descreasing and as a ersult will make connections to other services slow too.

2.1 Have timeout for requests
e.g in RestTemplate
still problem as threads are blocked even for short time and it in big perspective will lead to no free threads


2.2 Circuit breaker
Detect smth is wrong
Take temp steps not to have it getting worse
Deactivate the "problem" to not affect downstream components
Especially important when there are few calls to separate services in one service
If there are 2 cals with one method, histrix will not work cause it is a proxy and proxy has no affect on internal calls.
So all @HystrixCommand method should be placed in another class.

2.3 Bulkhead patterns
Have separate thread pools for every service
Can be setup via Hystrix as well @HystrixCommand
